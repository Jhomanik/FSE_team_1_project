# FSE_team_1_project


Our project  is called ImageCaption. In it we will provide a repository for demonstrating the work of a trained neural network, which, based on pictures, generates their text description. The repository will contain a neural network model, unit tests, main code for training and code for work demonstration. We use Docker for easy launching and distribution and unit tests for testing.

Our network will be based on article https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044
